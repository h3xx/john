.SH NAME
unique \- removes duplicates from a wordlist
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B unique
\fIoutput-file\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B unique
command, which is part of the john package.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
\fBjohn\fP, better known as John the Ripper, is a tool to find weak
passwords of users in a server.
.br
The \fBunique\fP tool finds and removes duplicate entries from a
wordlist (read from stdin), without changing the order. This is important
to increase the performance of john when using the wordlist method.

which should be available in \fI/usr/share/doc/john\fP or other
location, depending on your system.
